Hello
It is a simple command line 2048 game.

The preferred operating system is Windows.
All you need to do is to open the "main.c: file in your IDE & run it.
Make sure you have C/CPP installed.

Screenshots of the output & recorder video demo is in Screenshots & Tutorial folder respectively.

The rules are same as that of game.
If you face any issue or need any change in it, just drop a message, I will be available.

If you think that "what you needed is delivered" then please close the order.
If you encounter any error after closing the order then don't worry, i will be available to help you out.

It was nice experience working with you!
Thank You!
